Simon Gravel is associate professor in the [Department of Human Genetics](https://www.mcgill.ca/humangenetics/) at McGill University, with affiliations in Computer Science, Quantitive Biology, Epidemiology and Biostatistics, and Physics. His graduate training was in Mathematics and Physics at the Université de Montréal and Cornell University, and did postdocs in Genetics in Cologne and Stanford universities. 

He tries to understand the relationship between genetic diversity, history, biology, and disease. A lot of his work is through mathematics and statistics, with collaborations with people who know biology, history and anthropology. He is also scientific co-director of the [CARTaGENE cohort](https://cartagene.qc.ca/).

## Georgette Femerling <a href="https://github.com/georgette-femerling"><i class="fab fa-fw fa-github zoom" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>

Georgette graduated from the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) in 2021 with a B.Sc in Genomic Sciences, during which she developed interest in population genetics by working in projects focused on human evolution and endangered birds. She joined the lab in January 2022 as MSc Student in the department of Human Genetics. She is interested in structured populations and demography. Her research aims to understand how LD statistics can be used to detect ancient structure and to validate demographic inference.

## Gerardo Martinez <a href="https://github.com/gerardo-martinez-j"><i class="fab fa-fw fa-github zoom" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>

Gerardo is a PhD student currently working with sexual chromosomes and their link with genealogical data. He received a Bachelor’s Degree in Statistics and an MsC in Engineering Mathematics, both from Universidad de la República, in Uruguay. His interests in science are Probability and Statistics, and their interplay with Population Genetics. Outside of the lab, Gerardo can be found looking for new bands to listen to, going to concerts, reading, or learning about language quirks.
